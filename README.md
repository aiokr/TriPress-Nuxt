# Tripper Press

Tripper Press is my personal blog. It based on Nuxt and Nuxt Content Plugin.

## Timeline for Tripper Press

- 2016 - 2022: My blog was built with Jekyll and Hexo. In this period, I developed a theme for Hexo called [hexo-theme-type](https://github.com/aiokr/Hexo-Theme-Type).
- 2023: I migrated my blog to Next.js and Vercel. I also migrated my content to [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/), and then to [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).
- 2024: Now, I migrated my blog to Nuxt.js. In this iteration, I will focus on writing articles on my blog, and I will move my photos and albums to [Photup.art](https://photup.art).
